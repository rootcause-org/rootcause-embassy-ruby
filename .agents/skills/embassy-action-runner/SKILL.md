description: Maintain the rootcause Ruby Embassy's signed boundaries — the inbound action invocation route, the inbound analysis-result route, and the outbound trigger/sent-message/API calls. Use when changing wire fields, HMAC/replay handling, schema validation, digest resolution, trusted tenant context, script execution, timeouts/deadlines, the Result surface, or host wire-contract compatibility in rootcause-embassy-ruby.

# Embassy (Ruby)

Read `AGENTS.md` and `SPEC.md` completely before changing behavior. For anything that crosses the
wire, the authority is the contract hub `rootcause-embassy`: `CONTRACT.md`, the matching
`planes/*.md`, `decisions.md`, and the case list in `conformance.md`. A wire change starts there,
never here.

Everything lives under `lib/rootcause/embassy/` (the pre-0.3.0 `lib/rootcause/action_runner/` namespace
is gone). Stdlib only — no runtime dependencies.

Inline action attachments: `inline_attachments.rb` validates the signed parameter-keyed map and
materializes bounded, hash-checked temporary files. `executor.rb` exposes `RC_ACTION_ATTACHMENTS`
and `RC_ACTION_DEADLINE_AT` only inside the execution mutex, restoring both and deleting files on
every exit. Params retain UUIDs only. `rack.rb` bounds action bodies independently of Content-Length;
`runner.rb` advertises `attachments_inline`. Per-file corruption reaches the script as an error so
it can preserve primary work; malformed metadata or limits refuse before execution.

## Two inbound routes, deliberately asymmetric

| | invocation (`mount_at`) | result (`result_mount_at`) |
|---|---|---|
| core | `runner.rb` (`Runner`) | `result_rack.rb` (`ResultReceiver`) |
| shell | `rack.rb` (`RackApp`) | `result_rack.rb` (`ResultRackApp`) |
| shared | `signed_endpoint.rb` (verify→parse→signed refusal) | `rack_shell.rb` (body/header/405/503 → Rack triple) |
| direction | host → gem, runs an action | host → gem, delivers an analysis result |
| duplicate nonce | **409 replay** | **idempotent signed `200 {"ok":true}` ack** |
| stale `issued_at` | 409 | 409 |

The result route's dedupe is the whole point of the asymmetry: rootcause sends a **stable
`nonce = run_id`** across redeliveries of the same result, so a duplicate is a redelivery to ack, not
an attack to refuse. `Replay.guard!` raises on a seen nonce (invocation); `Replay.fresh?` returns
`false` instead (result). The receiver consumes the nonce *before* dispatch and **releases** it
(`store.delete`, when the store supports it) if dispatch raises, so a refused delivery is still
retryable by the host. Handlers must stay idempotent regardless.

## Trust path (invocation)

- Verify HMAC over raw bytes before JSON parsing (`runner.rb` → `signature.rb`). A blank secret fails
  closed in both directions — never sign with one, never accept one.
- Replay-guard `issued_at` + `nonce`, then validate host-owned fields and model-influenced params.
- Resolve only a signed, digest-matching `script.rb` through `resolver.rb`.
- Execute through `executor.rb`; params stay frozen data. Trusted tenant and optional principal context
  come only from signed top-level fields and are installed during serialized execution.
- Sign every structured result/refusal over the exact response bytes.

Never derive tenant identity from `params`. A bound signed invocation carries `tenant_id` +
`tenant_slug` and may carry `tenant_scope_value`; a flat invocation omits all three to preserve its
original bytes. Tenant-enabled deployments set `require_tenant_context = true`, which rejects an absent
tuple before resolving the script unless its signed `action_id` is explicitly listed in
`tenantless_actions`. That allowlist is for globally unique flat-project actions whose reviewed body
derives its tenant from the target record; partial tuples always refuse, and complete tuples remain
valid. The executor removes stale `RC_TENANT_*` first and installs only
non-empty trusted values, so flat/missing scope stays absent. Reserve both tenant field names and
  `RC_TENANT_*` names from action schemas. The optional principal requires non-empty `kind` and
  `external_id`, plus a claims object (which may be empty) of typed named claims; reserve
  `principal_kind`, `principal_external_id`, every `principal_claim_*`, and every `RC_PRINCIPAL_*`
  spelling. The executor clears inherited `RC_PRINCIPAL_*`, exposes a signed principal
  only for its action, then restores the prior process environment. Validate bound ids as non-nil UUIDs,
  slugs with the host's canonical slug rule, and all env-bound values as NUL-free before resolving the script.

**One deadline for the whole invocation.** The host waits ~25s, one shot, no retry, so `Runner#handle`
wraps the entire pipeline (fetch **and** execute) in `config.total_deadline` (22s) and returns the
executor's own timeout-style failure envelope on breach. `config.timeout` (20s) is the execute backstop
*inside* that budget; `validate!` refuses a `total_deadline` that does not exceed it.

`dry_run` is a JSON boolean or absent — nothing else. `parse` refuses a non-boolean with
`400 invalid_request` **before** the signed script fetch; Ruby truthiness would otherwise read `"no"`
as "yes, dry run". The envelope is emitted in the hub's canonical key order so the conformance suite
can compare our own bytes to the goldens (key order itself is not contract).

## Inline action attachments

`inline_attachments.rb` validates the optional signed parameter-keyed map before resolution, then
materializes strict base64 chunks to invocation-scoped tempfiles inside the execution mutex.
Shape, selection, duplicates or caps → signed 400; decode/size/digest mismatch → per-file `corrupt`.
Missing authorized blobs arrive as `unavailable`. Params remain UUID arrays. Never log bytes.

`RC_ACTION_ATTACHMENTS` preserves parameter names and `mime_type`, with `path` or `error` per file.
`RC_ACTION_DEADLINE_AT` is the earliest total/execution cutoff minus two seconds. The executor clears
stale values, restores prior values and removes files on every outcome. Dry run validates without
materializing. Rack reads action bodies at most 32 MiB + one detection byte regardless of headers;
an oversized map-mode body that cannot select a key keeps the opaque unsigned selector refusal.
Signed health advertises `attachments_inline`; conformance uses its optional health golden.

## Outbound (client.rb)

- `start_analysis` — signed trigger. Optional `principal:` `{kind:, external_id:, asserted_by:,
  assurance:, tenant_hint:, source_metadata:}`: exact host field names, nils omitted, `kind` +
  `external_id` required together (raises pre-POST). Assert it from the customer app's own
  authenticated session — **never from model output**.
  Attachments are capped twice, both raised **before** the POST: `max_attachment_bytes` per
  attachment and `max_total_attachment_bytes` (6 MiB, the host's aggregate limit) across the trigger.
- `capture_sent_message` — `metadata` is exactly `{resource_type, resource_id}` (strings). It accepts
  `answers: [{id:, values: [...] }]` with a sent body or alone; answers-only capture omits `sent` and
  surfaces the child `analysis_id` returned by the host.
- **Direction rule:** trigger-direction routes (`/analyses/*`) are **strict** host-side (unknown field
  → 400); the action/result direction is tolerant-inbound. Never send a speculative field outbound.

## The Result surface (`result.rb`)

Mirrors the host's `webhook.AnalysisResult` verbatim. `actions[]` are **proposals** (render as confirm
buttons); `executed_actions[]` **already ran** mid-loop under the host's autonomy gate (render as
outcomes — never buttons); `questions[]` are answered back over `capture_sent_message`; `delete_ids`
is the wire's reserved-word `delete` (note keys the run retracts). `reasoning_steps` was gem-only
fiction and is deleted — the host never sent it.

An action's optional `resource_url` is render-only (hub decision 17). A value that is not an absolute
`http(s)` URL is dropped from that action and the callback is still acked — the analysis is the
payload, the decoration is not.

## File map

- `runner.rb`: authenticated invocation pipeline, trusted host-field validation, total deadline.
- `result_rack.rb`: result route core + Rack shell; idempotent redelivery ack.
- `signed_endpoint.rb`: the half both inbound cores share — verify-then-parse, required fields,
  signed refusal/500 backstop, unsigned selector/plane-disabled replies.
- `rack_shell.rb`: the Rack half both mounts share — raw body, signature header, content type,
  405 + `allow`, plane-disabled triple. `route` is the hook RackApp uses for its health child.
- `reply.rb`: the signed `Reply` (status/body/signature) both endpoints return; `Reply.unsigned`
  for the answers with no key to sign with. `Runner::Reply` stays as an alias.
- `util.rb`: `blank?`/`present?` (wire semantics), `unset?` (boot-gate semantics, whitespace counts
  as unset), monotonic clock readers.
- `replay.rb`: ±5 min window, nonce store (`guard!` raises / `fresh?` reports), `MemoryStore`.
- `schema.rb`: action param contract and reserved tenant/principal selectors (including
  `principal_claim_*`).
- `resolver.rb`: signed script fetch + digest verification/cache.
- `inline_attachments.rb`: signed descriptor validation, fleet caps, chunk decoding and tempfile lifecycle.
- `executor.rb`: compiled Ruby body, trusted `ENV`, invocation-scoped context, execute timeout, stdout, structured failure.
- `client.rb`: outbound trigger + sent-message capture.
- `config.rb`: every knob, validated fail-closed at boot.
- `errors.rb`: typed customer diagnostics (`code`/`hint`/`docs`) plus signed refusal wire classes.
- `chat.rb`: standalone chat with a 24-hour TTL cap, hosted base-URL default, and mode/target validation.
- `spec/support/wire.rb`: Ruby-side host fixture builder; keep it aligned with host goldens.
- `spec/fixtures/contract/`: vendored canonical goldens — synced wholesale from the contract hub,
  with the source revision recorded in `HUB_SHA`, not hand-edited.

`chat.rb` owns `LOADER_CONTRACT` (currently `5`). `getPageContext` is an integrator-owned
browser boot callback; page URL/context are untrusted turn hints, never JWT claims or signed
Embassy fields. SDK fan-out bumps the loader revision and vendors the complete hub fixtures;
`chat/page_url.json` is unsigned browser/host test data, not a Ruby sanitizer contract.

## House cops and CI

`lib/rubocop/cop/embassy/` holds tiny line cops, wired in through `.rubocop.yml` (merged into
StandardRB via `.standard.yml`), so `bundle exec rake` enforces them:

- `WireClassVocabulary` — a `wire_class:` literal must be in CONTRACT.md's refusal table. Ruby-only
  `action_plane_disabled` is allow-listed until the hub rules on it.
- `InternalErrorLogMessage` — the internal_error log line carries the exception class, never its text.
- `LongSpecSleep` — no multi-second `sleep` in specs; scope a sub-second timeout instead.
- `SharedBlankHelper` / `SignatureHeaderEnv` — **shipped disabled**, red until the shared `Util` and
  Rack shell land. Flip `Enabled: true` in `.rubocop.yml` then.

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `bundle exec rake`, then proves `spec/fixtures/contract/` is
byte-identical to the hub at the recorded `HUB_SHA`, and that the hub has not touched `fixtures/`
since. Passing tests on stale goldens is still out of conformance.

## Verification

Run `bundle exec rake` (StandardRB + all RSpec). For wire changes, cover exact signed success,
tampering, missing/malformed fields, flat context, and param/host separation.
`spec/contract/wire_spec.rb` carries both halves of the hub's conformance rule: it verifies the hub's
bytes AND replays Ruby's own serialization back to the goldens (envelopes, health, ack, fetch query,
trigger/sent-message/answers bodies), injecting the fixtures' reference clock and nonce.
`Config` validates only requested planes, so chat-only configuration stays action-secret-free.
