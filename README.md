# rootcause-embassy

> **Renamed:** this gem was `rootcause-action-runner` (namespace `RootCause::ActionRunner`) ≤ 0.2.0.
> It is now **`rootcause-embassy`** / `RootCause::Embassy` as of 0.3.0.

The Ruby **Embassy** is rootcause's trusted, in-app presence inside your Rails/Rack runtime.

It does four things:

1. **Chat** — mint the short-lived token that lets a signed-in user chat with rootcause in your UI.
2. **Actions** — receive a signed, digest-pinned invocation and run the approved script against your app.
3. **Analysis** — ask rootcause to analyze content and receive the drafted answer later.
4. **API** — call any rootcause API endpoint with bearer auth handled for you.

No executable code travels on the wire. Runtime dependencies: Ruby standard library only.

> The authoritative design of this gem is [SPEC.md](SPEC.md); the cross-language wire contract every
> Embassy implements is [`rootcause-embassy/CONTRACT.md`](https://github.com/rootcause-org/rootcause-embassy/blob/main/CONTRACT.md), and the
> integrator guides live in [`docs/integrator/`](https://github.com/rootcause-org/rootcause-embassy/tree/main/docs/integrator).

## Install

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "rootcause-embassy"
```

## Chat quickstart

Start with chat only. No action secret, fetch endpoint, or action route is required.
`chat_base_url` defaults to `https://app.replypen.com`; the long-lived chat secret remains in your
backend and never reaches HTML or JavaScript.

```ruby
# config/initializers/rootcause.rb
RootCause::Embassy.configure do |c|
  c.chat_secret  = ENV.fetch("ROOTCAUSE_CHAT_SECRET")
  c.chat_project = ENV.fetch("ROOTCAUSE_CHAT_PROJECT")
  c.logger = Rails.logger
end
```

```erb
<%# Inside an authenticated view; identity and tenant come from server-side authorization. %>
<div id="replypen-chat"></div>
<%= RootCause::Embassy::Chat.widget_tag_html(
      external_id: current_user.id.to_s,
      kind: "app_user",
      tenant: current_tenant&.slug,
      origin: request.base_url,
      mode: :page,
      target: "#replypen-chat"
    ).html_safe %>
```

Mint a fresh token on every render. A long-lived SPA re-mints at half-life; the loader handles
`auth-expired` with a guarded host-page reload. Token TTL defaults to two hours and cannot exceed 24
hours. The complete Rails controller, view, routes, and CSP checklist are in
[`examples/rails-chat`](https://github.com/rootcause-org/rootcause-embassy-ruby/tree/main/examples/rails-chat).

Setup failures are typed and safe to branch on:

```ruby
rescue RootCause::Embassy::Error => error
  Rails.logger.warn("ReplyPen setup failed: #{error.code}")
end
```

Meaning, self-fix steps, verification, and escalation live in the public
[integrator guides](https://github.com/rootcause-org/rootcause-embassy/tree/main/docs/integrator).

## Add actions and analysis later

`configure` replaces the current configuration, so call it exactly once. To add actions to the
chat-first setup, merge these fields into the same initializer block (the full block is shown here).

```ruby
# config/initializers/rootcause.rb
RootCause::Embassy.configure do |c|
  c.chat_secret  = ENV.fetch("ROOTCAUSE_CHAT_SECRET")
  c.chat_project = ENV.fetch("ROOTCAUSE_CHAT_PROJECT")
  c.secret    = ENV.fetch("ROOTCAUSE_ACTION_SECRET") # reverse-channel HMAC secret (per project)
  c.fetch_url = "https://<rootcause>/actions/script" # script-by-digest endpoint
  c.timeout   = 20                                   # hard per-EXECUTION timeout (seconds)
  c.total_deadline = 22                              # budget for the WHOLE invocation (fetch + execute)
  c.require_tenant_context = true                    # REQUIRED on tenant-enabled projects
  c.tenantless_actions = %w[staff_flat_action]       # narrow exceptions by signed action id
  c.logger    = Rails.logger
end
```

`configure` validates fail-closed at boot: a missing `secret` or `fetch_url`, or a `total_deadline`
that does not exceed `timeout`, raises immediately. The host waits ~25s for an invocation and **never
retries**, so the gem bounds the *whole* invocation (script fetch **and** execution) under
`total_deadline`; `timeout` remains the execute backstop inside it. A breach returns the same signed
`Timeout::Error` failure result an over-long body would.

One mount may serve several projects without sharing a reverse key. Configure **exactly one** of the
single `secret` above or a non-empty UUID map; map values must be non-blank:

```ruby
RootCause::Embassy.configure do |c|
  c.secrets = {
    "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111" => ENV.fetch("ROOTCAUSE_ACTION_SECRET_SUPPORT"),
    "22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222" => ENV.fetch("ROOTCAUSE_ACTION_SECRET_BILLING"),
  }
  c.fetch_url = "https://<rootcause>/actions/script"
end
```

Map mode reads only unverified `project_id` to choose a candidate, then verifies the exact raw bytes.
A missing, malformed, or unknown selector is an opaque unsigned `401 bad_signature`; a bad HMAC for
a known action or result callback receives the usual refusal signed with that project's key. Result
callbacks require `project_id` in map mode. The health probe is `GET /rootcause/action/health?project_id=<uuid>`,
signed over the raw query; invalid health probes stay opaque unsigned `404`, and single-secret
deployments also accept the legacy empty query.

Tenant-enabled Embassy deployments **must** set `require_tenant_context = true`; this refuses a signed
tenantless invocation before script resolution. A deployment serving a genuinely flat sibling project
may explicitly allow selected globally unique action ids through `tenantless_actions`; partial tuples
still refuse, and all other actions remain strict. Flat deployments leave the strict default `false` so
their wire remains unchanged. Other tunables (with defaults): `clock_skew` (300s replay window half-width), `cache_dir`
(`tmp/rootcause/actions`, set `nil` for memory-only), `capture_stdout` (true), `max_stdout_bytes`
(64 KiB), `max_backtrace_lines` (50), `http_open_timeout` / `http_read_timeout`.

## Mount

Explicit mount — least magic, easiest to restrict at the edge:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
mount RootCause::Embassy::RackApp.new => RootCause::Embassy.config.mount_at
```

**Recommended (documented, not enforced in v1):** restrict the route to rootcause's egress IP at the
edge, and run under a least-privileged DB role where feasible.

Mounting the action (and result) routes in a **chat-only** deployment is safe: with no action secret
there is nothing to sign with, so every request — including the `/health` child — gets an unsigned
`503 ACTION_PLANE_DISABLED` carrying its own `code` / `hint` / `docs`. Chat can never switch the
action plane on: the plane is enabled only by configuring `secret` (or `secrets`) **and** `fetch_url`.
`start_analysis` / `capture_sent_message` refuse the same way, with
`ANALYSIS_TRIGGER_URL_REQUIRED` / `SENT_MESSAGE_URL_REQUIRED` / `ACTION_PLANE_DISABLED`.

## What it does, in order (fail-closed at every step)

1. **Verify** `X-Webhook-Signature: sha256=<hex>` over the **raw** body (HMAC-SHA256, constant-time).
2. **Replay-guard** — reject if `issued_at` is outside ±`clock_skew`, or `nonce` was already seen.
3. **Validate trusted tenant context** — signed `tenant_id`, `tenant_slug`, and `tenant_scope_value`
   fields are host-owned; flat runs must omit them, while bound runs require id + slug together.
4. **Validate params** against the `schema` carried in the invocation (defense in depth); tenant
   selector names are reserved and refused.
5. **Resolve the script by digest** — cache hit (`sha256 == digest`) or fetch + verify; mismatch is a
   hard refuse.
6. **Bind + execute** — params as a frozen, symbol-keyed hash, **as data, never interpolated into
   source**; trusted tenant context is available as `RC_TENANT_ID`, `RC_TENANT_SLUG`, and
   `RC_TENANT_SCOPE_VALUE` for the duration of the action.
7. **Hard timeout** (execute backstop, inside the invocation-wide `total_deadline`) + rescue
   everything → structured `error{class, message, backtrace}` (`backtrace` is a newline-joined
   **string**, capped at `max_backtrace_lines` frames — the wire contract's type).
8. **Return signed JSON** — `{ ok, return_value | error, stdout, duration_ms }`. Logs `action_id`,
   `digest`, param **keys**, `ok`, `duration_ms` — never the secret or param values.

## Security posture (honest caveats)

- **Not a sandbox.** Runs in-process as the app, full privileges. The boundary is: approved +
  digest-pinned scripts only, signature + replay on the channel, params bound as data, dual-sided
  audit. Real isolation is a later runtime swap.
- **`Timeout.timeout` is a backstop, not a transaction boundary** — it raises asynchronously and can
  fire mid-transaction. Actions must be written idempotent and safe to retry.
- **The digest is the authorization unit.** A body runs **iff** its `sha256` equals the
  `script_digest` in the signed invocation.
- **Tenant scope is host-owned.** Action scripts must scope tenant-aware writes with the applicable
  `RC_TENANT_*` field. `params` cannot carry tenant selectors. Flat runs remove these variables, as
  does an absent/empty optional scope value.

## Async analysis (trigger + result callback)

The opposite direction of the invocation flow, on the **same reverse-channel secret**: your app asks
rootcause to *analyze this* and later receives the drafted answer into a Ruby handler — no polling, no
job rig of your own. The host keeps the conversation history keyed by an opaque **`session_id`**, so a
follow-up sends only the new message — persist the `session_id` and pass it back. See
[docs/async-analysis-spec.md](docs/async-analysis-spec.md).

```ruby
# Add these lines inside the single configure block above.
c.trigger_url     = "https://<rootcause>/analyses/<project>" # where start_analysis POSTs
c.result_mount_at = "/rootcause/result"                      # route that receives async results
c.result_handler  = "AnalysisResultHandler"                  # String → lazy-loaded, reload-safe
c.max_attachment_bytes = 256 * 1024                          # per-attachment inline cap (decoded)
c.max_total_attachment_bytes = 6 * 1024 * 1024               # aggregate cap per trigger (decoded)
```

```ruby
# config/routes.rb — mount the result route alongside the invocation route
mount RootCause::Embassy::ResultRackApp.new => RootCause::Embassy.config.result_mount_at
```

**Trigger** from a background job (the trigger is a quick signed POST; running it off the request keeps
your controller fast and lets you retry on `TriggerError`):

```ruby
# app/jobs/analyze_ticket_job.rb
class AnalyzeTicketJob < ApplicationJob
  def perform(ticket)
    analysis = RootCause::Embassy.start_analysis(
      subject: ticket.subject,
      body:    ticket.body,                       # plain text only (v1)
      attachments: [{filename: "error.log", mime_type: "text/plain",
                     content_base64: Base64.strict_encode64(ticket.log_file)}],
      metadata: {resource_type: "SupportTicket", resource_id: ticket.id}, # echoed back verbatim
      session_id: ticket.rc_session_id,           # nil on the first turn; set to continue
      project_id: "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111", # required only with c.secrets
    )
    ticket.update!(
      rc_analysis_id: analysis.analysis_id,       # persist alongside the resource
      rc_session_id:  analysis.session_id,        # persist too — forward to continue the thread
      analysis_state: :pending,
    )
  end
end
```

A non-2xx / transport failure raises `RootCause::Embassy::TriggerError` (yours to retry); an
over-cap or malformed attachment raises `ArgumentError` before anything is sent.

**Who it is for** — pass `principal:` when your app knows the authenticated end user behind the
trigger, so rootcause can scope the run's data access to them:

```ruby
principal: {kind: "app_user", external_id: current_user.id.to_s,
            asserted_by: "myapp", assurance: "customer_backend_session",
            tenant_hint: nil, source_metadata: nil} # nils are omitted from the wire
```

`kind` + `external_id` are required together (a partial assertion raises before the POST); the other
fields are optional. Assert it from your **own authenticated session** only — never from model output,
a URL parameter, or anything the end user can set. Omit the kwarg entirely when there is no
authenticated user. It stays dormant unless the project declares `scope_claims` host-side.

**Handle the result** — a plain class in `app/`, idempotent (rootcause **redelivers** on a lost ack):

```ruby
# app/rootcause/analysis_result_handler.rb
class AnalysisResultHandler < RootCause::Embassy::ResultHandler
  def process(result)
    return unless result.metadata[:resource_type] == "SupportTicket"
    ticket = SupportTicket.find_by(id: result.metadata[:resource_id]) or return

    if result.decline
      ticket.update!(analysis_state: :declined, analysis_note: result.decline[:reason])
    else
      ticket.update!(analysis_state: :ready,
        ai_draft:        result.draft, # markdown string (the drafted answer)
        ai_note:         result.note,  # markdown string (the summary note)
        rc_session_id:   result.session_id, # persist to continue the thread later
        rc_actions:      result.actions) # human-gated buttons — render, never auto-execute
    end
  end
end
```

`result.draft` and `result.note` are **markdown strings** — `draft` is the drafted answer's
`body_markdown`; `note` is the *summary* note's `body_markdown` (rootcause delivers `notes[]` — one
summary note plus widget notes; the gem surfaces only the summary, whose body carries the run-trace as
a markdown link). HTML is used only as a fallback when markdown is absent. `draft` / `note` /
`attachments` / `questions` are informational (safe to auto-burn); **`actions[]`** are vetted
side-effects rootcause *proposes* — render them for a human to click, and they ride back through the
**invocation route**. The gem never auto-runs them. An action may carry an optional
**`resource_url`**: an absolute link to the record it would modify in *your own* admin UI. It is
render-only — a secondary "view record" link beside the confirm button, never the confirm target
(that is `url`). A `resource_url` that is not an absolute `http(s)` link is dropped from the action;
the rest of the result is still delivered, because a bad decoration must not cost you the draft.

Two more lists complete the surface:

- **`executed_actions[]`** — `{id:, slug:, label:, ok:, summary:}` for actions the run **already ran**
  mid-loop (the project's autonomy gate was open). The write has happened: render them as **outcomes /
  history, never as confirm buttons**.
- **`questions[]`** — the run's clarifying questions. Render them in your own UI and POST the human's
  answers back with `capture_sent_message` on the same `session_id`.
- **`delete_ids`** — wire key `delete` (a Ruby reserved word, hence the accessor name): note `key`s the
  run retracts. Dropping an unknown key is a no-op.

**Redelivery is idempotent at the route.** rootcause sends a **stable** `nonce` (the run id) on every
redelivery of the same result, so a duplicate inside the replay window is acked with the same signed
`200 {"ok":true}` and is **not** dispatched twice — no 409. (A stale `issued_at` is still a 409.) If
your handler *raises*, the delivery is refused with a signed 500 and the nonce is released, so the
host's next redelivery does reach the handler — keep `process` idempotent.

**Continue the conversation** — the host keeps the history keyed by `session_id`, so a follow-up sends
**only the new message** (never prior turns):

```ruby
RootCause::Embassy.start_analysis(
  subject:    "Still failing after the reset",
  body:       customer_reply,                      # just the new message
  session_id: ticket.rc_session_id,                # the id you persisted above
  metadata:   {resource_type: "SupportTicket", resource_id: ticket.id},
)
```

`session_id` is **opaque** to the gem — store it and forward it, never interpret it. Omit it (or pass
`nil`) on the first turn; the host mints one and returns it in the 202.

Answers may accompany a sent reply or travel alone. An answers-only capture triggers a grounded rerun
and returns its `analysis_id` when the host accepts it:

```ruby
capture = RootCause::Embassy.capture_sent_message(
  session_id: ticket.rc_session_id,
  answers: [{id: "country", values: ["BE"]}]
)
ticket.update!(rc_analysis_id: capture.analysis_id) if capture.analysis_id
```

## Call any rootcause endpoint (the API plane)

`RootCause::Embassy.api` is a **generic** authenticated caller for rootcause's HTTP API — the same
surface the `rc` CLI drives — so a new host endpoint is usable the day it ships, with no gem release
and no per-endpoint wrapper. The gem owns auth (including the OAuth `rcor_` → `rcoa_` exchange and
its cache), timeouts and JSON; you own the path and the body. **What endpoints exist is the host's
contract** — see rootcause's API spec/manifest. Full details:
[docs/generic-api.md](docs/generic-api.md).

```ruby
# config/initializers/rootcause.rb — extends the block above (both or neither)
RootCause::Embassy.configure do |c|
  c.api_base_url = ENV.fetch("ROOTCAUSE_API_BASE_URL") # e.g. "https://app.replypen.com"
  c.api_key      = ENV.fetch("ROOTCAUSE_API_KEY")      # rcor_… machine credential
end
```

```ruby
result = RootCause::Embassy.api.patch("/api/v1/tenants/#{slug}/profile",
  body: {settings: {iban: "BE80 7350 6212 7777", care_hours: "8:00 - 17:30"}, source: "embassy"})

result.ok?          # 2xx?
result.status       # HTTP status (nil on a transport/auth failure)
result.body         # parsed JSON when it parses, else the raw String
result.field_errors # the host's per-field validation rejections on a 4xx
result.retryable?   # transport / auth / 5xx / 429 / 408 → true; any other 4xx → false
```

Refresh tokens are **project-pinned**: to talk to a second rootcause project, build an independent
caller with its own credential and its own token cache (the configured singleton is untouched):

```ruby
RootCause::Embassy.api_for(api_base_url: ENV.fetch("ROOTCAUSE_API_BASE_URL"),
                           api_key: ENV.fetch("ROOTCAUSE_SUPPORT_API_KEY"))
```

An HTTP outcome **never raises** — inspect the frozen result (`retryable?` tells a job whether to
re-enqueue). Only a misconfiguration or bad argument raises `ArgumentError`. `api_key` is a **third,
separate** privilege boundary: never the action `secret`, never `chat_secret`, and none falls back to
another. Both settings are optional — an Embassy that never calls `.api` behaves exactly as before.

## Embedded chat (mint a token, drop in the widget)

Let a signed-in user chat with the rootcause agent from inside your app. Your backend mints a
short-lived, single-use HS256 token; the browser never holds the key, so it cannot chat as another
user, in another tenant, from another origin, or past the expiry.

The chat key is the project's **`webhook_secret`** — a **different** secret from the action
reverse-channel one, and neither falls back to the other. All three settings are optional: an Embassy
without chat behaves exactly as before.

```ruby
# Add these lines inside the existing configure block; never call configure twice.
c.chat_secret   = ENV.fetch("ROOTCAUSE_CHAT_SECRET")   # the project's webhook_secret
c.chat_project  = ENV.fetch("ROOTCAUSE_CHAT_PROJECT")  # public project slug
# c.chat_base_url = "https://app.replypen.com"          # this is already the default
```

```erb
<%# app/views/…, with `include RootCause::Embassy::ChatViewHelper` in a helper %>
<%= chat_widget_tag(external_id: current_admin_user.id,
                    kind:        "app_user",
                    tenant:      ActsAsTenant.current_tenant.slug,
                    origin:      request.base_url,
                    locale:      I18n.locale,
                    color_scheme: "light",
                    mode:        :page, target: "#rc-chat") %>
```

`external_id` must be an **opaque, stable** user id (never a name/email) — rootcause anchors
conversation ownership to it. `tenant` is the rootcause tenant **slug**, required on tenant-enabled
projects, and must come from your **server-side authorized** tenant context (never client input):
every claim rides inside the signature, so a swapped tenant is simply an invalid token.

`locale` is optional and purely presentational — it sets the chat panel's UI language (`en`, `nl`,
`fr`; a region subtag like `nl-BE` is fine). Anything else falls back to the browser language and then
English. It rides both the claim and `data-rc-locale`, so the panel's server-rendered chrome is in the
right language from the first paint. Omit it to let the browser decide.

`color_scheme` is optional and purely presentational — it pins the chat panel to `light` or `dark`.
Anything else follows the viewer's own light/dark preference. It rides both the claim and
`data-rc-color-scheme`, so the panel paints in the right scheme from the first paint. Set it when your
app is always one scheme (e.g. an always-light admin); omit it to follow the viewer.

Outside Rails (or to mint the token yourself, e.g. for a JSON endpoint that refreshes an expiring
one):

```ruby
RootCause::Embassy.chat_token(external_id: user.id, kind: "app_user",
  tenant: tenant.slug, origin: "https://app.example.com", locale: "nl", color_scheme: "light",
  ttl: 7200)
# => "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs…"  (claims: sub/aud/iss/jti/origin/tenant/locale/color_scheme/iat/nbf/exp/principal — see SPEC.md §5b)
```

`RootCause::Embassy::Chat.widget_tag_html(...)` is the framework-agnostic core behind the view helper
(same options, returns an escaped plain `String`).

## Multi-worker deployments

The default nonce store is an in-process, TTL-pruned set — correct for a **single process**. Across
workers a replay could slip through on a second worker, so inject a shared store (anything responding
to `add?(nonce, ttl:)`, e.g. a `Rails.cache`-backed adapter using `write(unless_exist: true)`):

```ruby
runner = RootCause::Embassy::Runner.new(RootCause::Embassy.config, nonce_store: MyCacheStore.new)
mount RootCause::Embassy::RackApp.new(runner: runner) => "/rootcause/action"
```

The **result route** has its own nonce store with the same caveat — inject a shared one the same way:

```ruby
receiver = RootCause::Embassy::ResultReceiver.new(RootCause::Embassy.config, nonce_store: MyCacheStore.new)
mount RootCause::Embassy::ResultRackApp.new(receiver: receiver) => "/rootcause/result"
```

Give a shared **result-route** store a `delete(nonce)` too: the receiver calls it to release a nonce
whose dispatch failed, so the host's redelivery is processed instead of acked as a duplicate. A store
without it stays fail-closed (deduped) but loses that retry.

Likewise, `capture_stdout` swaps the **process-global** `$stdout` for the duration of a run; under a
multi-threaded server that briefly intercepts other threads' output. Set `capture_stdout = false` if
that matters in your deployment.

## Development

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec rake        # standardrb (lint, incl. this repo's house cops) + rspec
```

House cops live in `lib/rubocop/cop/embassy/` and are wired in through `.rubocop.yml` (merged into
StandardRB from `.standard.yml`). They guard contract invariants that live in the source as literals:
the refusal vocabulary, the internal-error log line, and second-long sleeps in specs. CI additionally
proves `spec/fixtures/contract/` is byte-identical to the contract hub at the recorded `HUB_SHA`, and
that the hub has not moved those goldens since.
