    # Replay guard: an invocation is accepted at most once, and only inside a
    # bounded freshness window. Two independent checks, both fail-closed:
    #
    #   1. Window — |now - issued_at| <= clock_skew (±5 min default).
    #   2. Nonce  — the nonce has not been seen before.
    #
    # The window bounds how long a captured invocation stays replayable, which in
    # turn bounds how long a nonce must be remembered: a nonce older than the full
    # window (2 * clock_skew) is already rejected by the window check, so the
    # store only needs to retain nonces that briefly.
