    # The async analysis result handed to the customer's ResultHandler. Field names
    # are taken VERBATIM from rootcause's webhook.CallbackPayload and ReplyPen's
    # contract so all three products serialize identically. A frozen, symbol-keyed
    # value object — the handler reads a stable, immutable bag.
    #
    # The SPEC §1 human-in-the-loop invariant is preserved by the field split:
    # draft / note / reasoning_steps / attachments are informational (safe to
    # auto-burn into the customer's records); `actions[]` are vetted side-effects
    # rootcause PROPOSES — the customer renders them for a human to click, and they
    # ride back through the gem's existing invocation route. The gem never auto-runs
    # them, so no "autonomous action" feature is needed.
    #
    # `draft` and `note` are surfaced as **markdown strings**, not the raw nested
    # nodes: `draft` is the drafted answer's `body_markdown`; `note` is the SUMMARY
    # note's `body_markdown` (rootcause delivers `notes[]` keyed by `key` — one
    # `summary` note plus zero or more other-keyed notes, e.g. a `trace` link note;
    # we surface only the summary). HTML is a fallback only when markdown is absent
    # (the host is migrating notes from `body_html` to `body_markdown`). The run-trace
    # link is read programmatically from `metadata[:trace_url]`, not parsed out of a
    # note body.
    #
    # `session_id` is the host-managed conversation key — opaque to the gem. Persist
    # it on the record and pass it back to start_analysis to continue the thread; a
    # follow-up then sends only the new message (the host keeps prior history).
