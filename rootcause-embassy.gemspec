  spec.description = <<~DESC
    The Embassy is rootcause's trusted, in-app presence inside the customer's own
    Rails/Rack runtime — the far end of the reverse channel. It executes actions
    (receives a signed, digest-pinned invocation from the rootcause host, resolves
    the action's script by digest, runs it inline with a hard timeout, returns a
    signed structured result) and receives async-analysis results, all using the
    customer's own env, code, and tooling. No executable code ever travels on the
    wire. This Ruby gem is the first manifestation; PHP/Node/.NET Embassies ship as
    their own per-language repos.
